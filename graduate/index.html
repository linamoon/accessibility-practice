       <p>Edith O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s vision for the institute she founded includes a new Master&#8217;s program in art history, and her endowment provides graduate fellowships for young scholars of outstanding potential.</p>
       <p>In Fall 2017, pending University approval, the Edith O&#8217;Donnell Institute of Art History will launch a Master&#8217;s program that will be a collaboration between the O&#8217;Donnell Institute, The University of Texas at Dallas, and the <a href="http://www.dma.org">Dallas Museum of Art</a>. </p>
      <p>The planned Master&#8217;s Program in Art History at the O&#8217;Donnell Institute will train students who wish to pursue careers in research, education, museums, and conservation, and will foster in particular the exploration of interdisciplinary approaches to art history.</p>

      <p>Our proposed curriculum is designed to introduce students to a world history of art through close engagement with artworks held in Dallas-Fort Worth collections, developing students&#8217; knowledge of a broad range of material across geography, chronology, and medium and building strong foundations in historiography, theory, and professional practices. </p>
      <p>The planned Master&#8217;s Program at the O&#8217;Donnell Institute will be distinguished by </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a close partnership with the Dallas Museum of Art, providing unique access to the Museum&#8217;s collections and research resources </li>
        <li>the broad range of specialties of Institute-affiliated scholars, and the O&#8217;Donnell Institute&#8217;s particular strength in interdisciplinary connections between the visual arts and the sciences </li>
        <li>a practicum element in which students design and carry out an original project in the form of a scholarly essay, an exhibition, a collaboration with a practicing artist, a conservation project, or archival research </li>
        <li>and the opportunity to participate in the scholarly life of a center for advanced research</li>
      </ul>
