          <p><strong><em>Investigating the surface materials found on a collection of fourteen Jos&eacute; Posada printing blocks in the Amon Carter Museum of American Art </em></strong></p>
          <p>The aim of this project is to use a range of complimentary analytical techniques including sophisticated ion and electron beam based surface analysis tools such as electron microscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry to elucidate the surface chemistry and microstructure of printing blocks used by the Mexican printmaker Jos&eacute; Posada.</p>
          <p>Jos&eacute; Posada (1852-1913) was a key figure in the development of modern Mexican printmaking; his contribution to cultural imagery is unrivalled. He produced an estimated 15,000 different prints that documented every facet of Mexican life. His images, especially his <em>calaveras</em> (skeletons) portrayed in everyday tasks, have become icons typically associated with images for the Mexican celebration Day of the Dead. </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.cartermuseum.org/">The Amon Carter Museum</a> has one of the largest and best collections of Posada&#8217;s work, with more than 400 prints and 14 printing plates directly attributed to Posada. Research has been conducted on the synthetic dyes used to color Posada&#8217;s papers but his printing blocks have been left largely unstudied.</p>
