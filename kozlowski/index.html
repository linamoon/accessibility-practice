          <p>Dr. Sarah K. Kozlowski earned her BA in Art History (<em>summa cum laude</em>, Phi Beta Kappa) from <a href="http://wheatoncollege.edu">Wheaton College</a>, her MA from <a href="http://gradart.williams.edu">Williams College/The Clark Art Institute</a>, and her PhD from <a href="http://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a>.</p>
          <p>Focusing primarily on fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Naples, her work asks how paintings and other artworks figure their own condition of mobility, and how the materials of painting generate meaning. These and other questions are explored in &#8220;Circulation, Convergence, and the Worlds of Trecento Panel Painting: Simone Martini in Naples,&#8221; which appeared in <em>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Kunstgeschichte </em>78:2 (2015). </p>
          <p>Current projects include &#8220;Jan van Eyck&#8217;s <em>Saint George and the Dragon</em> between Bruges and Naples,&#8221;<strong> </strong>an essay on materiality and metapictoriality in Piero della Francesca&#8217;s <em>Legend of the True Cross</em>, a study of a fourteenth-century Neapolitan diptych, and a two-part installation and accompanying catalogue of the diptychs and polyptychs of the painter John Wilcox (co-curated with Benjamin Lima).</p>
          <p> Dr. Kozlowski was appointed Assistant Director of the O&#8217;Donnell Institute in February 2015. She oversees the Institute&#8217;s academic and research programs and other special projects. Once a year she offers a seminar that centers on artworks and other materials in Dallas-Fort Worth collections. </p>
          <p>In 2016 she will teach <em>The Painter at Work</em>, a course that explores the work of the painter as practice and idea. Through study of the writings of Renaissance painters, close engagement with paintings in area collections, and a series of visits to the studios of practicing artists, the course asks how materials, techniques, and the act of making shape a painting's meaning, and how art historians craft narratives of the material lives of artworks.</p>
