        <h2 class="subheader">The Cultural Science Lab brings together humanistic inquiry and scientific methods of analysis to explore culture as a complex system.</h2>
        <p>The process of understanding art and culture is driven primarily by qualitative humanistic inquiry. Within this process technology is used in data collection, material analysis, visualization, and ever closer or more distant readings than possible with the bare eye. Yet few humanists and technologists engage in true collaboration.</p>

        <p>Headed by <a href="http://www.schich.info">Dr. Maximilian Schich</a>, the Cultural Science Lab aims to show that the time is ripe for a new cultural science—for humanists to embrace physics, computer science, and information design, to engage in a coherent process in which humanists become scientists and scientists become humanists.</p>
        <p> Our goal is to understand culture as a complex system, the dynamics of canons and worldviews from games to scholarship, and the conscious knowledge of gaps and biases in our tools and perceptions—and to discover new frontiers of inquiry. </p>
        <p>The premise of our mission is that, like the shift from classic anatomy to systems biology, a transition to cultural science will radically change the way we work and understand the world.</p>
