        <p>The <a href="https://www.dma.org/">Dallas Museum of Art </a>opened its new <a href="https://www.dma.org/art/conservation-dma">Paintings Conservation Studio</a> in November 2013, as part of the Museum&#8217;s initiative to establish a comprehensive&nbsp;conservation program. The conservation program at the DMA is led by Chief Conservator <a href="https://www.dma.org/research/conservation-dma/meet-the-conservator">Mark Leonard</a> and is supported by Associate Conservator of Objects Fran Baas and Conservation Fellow Laura Hartman.</p>

        <p>The Paintings Conservation Studio features state-of-the-art technology—including a digital x-ray system—and serves as a center for study and treatment of works of art as well as research into cutting-edge conservation methodologies. The Studio is adjoined by a public exhibition gallery, which highlight the works of art on view from a conservation perspective.</p>
        <p>The Objects Conservation Laboratory at the DMA was established in 1981 and is equipped to handle the wide array of three-dimensional works of art found in the museum&#8217;s encyclopedic permanent collections.&nbsp; Treatments and technical studies focus on diverse materials ranging from ancient sculpture, to African art, to textiles, to contemporary works of art.</p>

          <li><a href="/arthistory/crucifix/">Conservation of a contemporary painting:  identifying the working methods and materials used by John Wilcox in the creation of Crucifix</a></li>
        </ul>
