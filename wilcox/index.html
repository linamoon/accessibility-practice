          <p><a href="http://johnwilcoxart.com">The Wilcox Space</a>, at the heart of Exposition Park in Dallas, is the former studio of the painter John Wilcox and a site for the study and exhibition of Wilcox&#8217;s work.</p>
          <p> The O&#8217;Donnell Institute collaborates with The Wilcox Space to present exhibitions of Wilcox&#8217;s paintings and works on paper and to publish accompanying catalogues. </p>
          <p>The first installation in the series was curated by Barry Whistler. The second installation, which focused on Wilcox&#8217;s early works between 1980 and 1983, was curated by Rick Brettell. The third presented Wilcox&#8217;s word drawings and was curated by Leigh Arnold. </p>

          <p>Currently at The Wilcox Space, <em>John Wilcox: Diptychs and Polyptychs </em>explores Wilcox&#8217;s engagement with the formal principles and expressive potential of the diptych and polyptych formats in work that spans the painter&#8217;s career and ranges across materials, techniques, and subject matter.</p>
          <p> The first in the two-part installation, opening in Fall 2015, is framed by Wilcox&#8217;s earliest experiments with narrative diptychs in the 1980s and sketches for a late portrait diptych left unfinished at his death in 2012. </p>
          <p>It focuses on a period between 1990 and 1993 during which Wilcox pushed the polyptych format to its visual and conceptual limits. </p>
          <p>The second installation, opening in April 2016, presents work from a period between 1986 and 1989 to reveal how Wilcox&#8217;s diptychs and polyptychs are related to his word drawings, both bodies of work engaging with repetition, seriality, and modularity.</p>
          <p><em>John Wilcox: Diptychs and Polyptychs </em>is curated by Sarah Kozlowski and Benjamin Lima in collaboration with The Wilcox Space. </p>
