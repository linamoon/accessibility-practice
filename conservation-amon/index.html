        <p>The <a href="http://www.cartermuseum.org">Amon Carter Museum of American Art</a> is home to the only museum conservation studio in North Texas specializing in the preservation of photographs and works of art on paper. It is staffed by Fernanda Valverde, Conservator of Photographs, and Jodie Utter, Conservator of Works on Paper. </p>
        <p>The Amon Carter&#8217;s 1,200-square-foot conservation studio is fully furnished with fundamental analytical and imaging instruments, along with advanced equipment for the specialized treatment of photographs and works on paper. It allows conservators to perform thorough examination, documentation, and treatment of works of art, as well as conduct preliminary testing of materials used by artists, conservators, and other museum personnel.</p>
        <p>In 2016 the conservation studio at the Amon Carter will collaborate with the O&#8217;Donnell Institute and The University of Texas at Dallas on two projects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/arthistory/pigment/"><em>Analysis of the Morton C. Bradley Historical Pigment Collection</em></a><em></em></li>
          <li><em><a href="/arthistory/posada/">Investigating the surface materials found on a collection of fourteen Jos&eacute; Posada printing blocks in the Amon Carter Museum of American Art </a></em></li>
