          <p>Terranova&#8217;s work centers on tracing the connections between biology, art, and architecture in the diaspora of the Bauhaus in England and the U.S. after 1933. <em>Art as Organism: Biology and the Evolution of the Digital Image</em> (IB Tauris, January 2016) links the emergence of the digital image to the dispersion of biocentric aesthetic philosophies developed by Bauhaus pedagogue L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, from 1920s Berlin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. </p>
          <p>It uncovers seminal but overlooked references to biology, the organism, feedback loops, emotions and the Gestalt, along with an intricate genealogy of related thinkers across disciplines. </p>
          <p>The forthcoming <em>Routledge, Companion to Biology in Art and Architecture </em>(June 2016), coedited by Terranova and San Francisco media artist Meredith Tromble, brings together thirty essays by artists, architects, theorists, and historians on the broad-ranging topic of <em>bios</em>, life as a matter of ecological relations, within art and architecture. </p>
          <p>With contributions from practitioners and historians, the anthology foregrounds contemporary bio-architecture and bio-art in the greater history of biology within art and architecture. </p>
