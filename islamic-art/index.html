          <h4>The Keir Collection of Islamic Art at the Dallas Museum of Art</h4>
          <p>In 2014 the <a href="http://dma.org/">Dallas Museum of Art</a> received a long-term loan of one of the world&#8217;s largest private holdings of Islamic art, transforming the Museum&#8217;s Islamic art collection into the third largest of its kind in North America. </p>
          <p>Assembled over the course of five decades by the noted art collector Edmund de Unger (1918–2011), the Keir Collection is recognized by scholars as one of the world&#8217;s most geographically and historically comprehensive, encompassing almost 2,000 works in a range of media that span thirteen centuries of Islamic art-making. </p>
          <p><em>Spirit and Matter: Masterpieces from the Keir Collection of Islamic Art</em> presents&nbsp;a selection of&nbsp;over fifty masterworks in&nbsp;various mediums—from rock crystal to works on paper, metalwork, ceramics, carpets, and textiles—and explores&nbsp;thirteen centuries of Islamic art making across&nbsp;three continents, from Spain to Central Asia. </p>
          <p><em>Spirit and Matter </em>was organized and developed by Dr. Sabiha Al Khemir, Senior Advisor for Islamic Art at the DMA and Distinguished Scholar of Islamic Art in Residence at the O&#8217;Donnell Institute.</p>

          <p>In Spring 2016 <a href="/arthistory/al-khemir/">Dr. Sabiha Al Khemir</a>, Senior Advisor for Islamic Art at the DMA and Distinguished Scholar of Islamic Art in Residence at the O&#8217;Donnell Institute, will offer a graduate course that introduces students to the arts of the Islamic world.</p>
          <p>Using material that covers a wide span of time and geographical area (from the 7th century onwards and from the Western Mediterranean to South Asia), the&nbsp;course explores&nbsp;the main&nbsp;characteristics of the visual language of the Islamic world, such as the significance of calligraphy, the abundance of&nbsp;pattern, and the question of figural representation.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The course also looks closely at some of the styles and major techniques of artistic production that reached a remarkable height in the arts of the Islamic world, such as&nbsp;ceramic&nbsp;luster and metal inlay. The&nbsp;seminar will engage students in&nbsp;close study of the art of the object and the cultural dimension objects carry.</p>
          <p>Research will&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on pieces from the Keir collection&nbsp;housed at the DMA, drawing parallels with other&nbsp;collections and building an understanding of Islamic art and culture, in its diversity and unity, in the context of world collections.&nbsp; </p>
