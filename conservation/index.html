        <p>The O&#8217;Donnell Institute and The University of Texas at Dallas have joined with the <a href="/arthistory/conservation-dma/">Dallas Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="/arthistory/conservation-amon/">Amon Carter Museum of American Art</a> in a partnership dedicated to advancing research and education in Conservation Science. </p>
        <p>Together, art historians, scientists, curators, and conservators collaborate on research projects that focus on developing new techniques for conserving artworks and understanding artists&#8217; materials and working methods.</p>
        <p>Our Conservation Science program is headed by <a href="/arthistory/mcphail/">Professor David McPhail</a>,Â Distinguished Chair of Conservation Science at The O&#8217;Donnell Institute and Professor in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, at The University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p>The aim of McPhail&#8217;s research is to&nbsp;work with museums to develop improvements to&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;practices&nbsp;that will extend the life of objects, making them accessible&nbsp;to future generations, and to deepen our understanding of artists&#8217; materials and techniques. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, our conservation projects provide hands-on training in conservation science for a new generation of conservators. </p>
        <p>We invite you to learn more about <a href="/arthistory/research">our ongoing research</a>. </p>
