        <p>The O&#8217;Donnell Institute and the Museo di Capodimonte are embarking on a unique partnership dedicated to scholarly exchange between Dallas and Naples. The aim of the collaboration is to use Naples as a laboratory to explore larger scholarly questions important to both Institute and Museum, including the history and practice of art conservation and the cultural histories of port cities.</p>
        <p>The O&#8217;Donnell Institute will sponsor promising scholars pursuing important projects on these and other topics to carry out research in Naples. The Museo di Capodimonte will offer lodging, access to Capodimonte collections, archives, and documentation, and connections with universities, libraries, scholars, and collectors in Naples. Fellows’ research projects will lead to small, focused exhibitions, public lectures, and bilingual publications involving the collaboration of both the O&#8217;Donnell Institute and the Museo di Capodimonte.</p>
