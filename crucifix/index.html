          <p>The aim of this project is to characterize the materials and processes used by the artist John Wilcox in the creation of his 1993 polyptych <em>Crucifix</em>. Complimentary analytical techniques will be applied in order to understand the object and the damage it has sustained over the years. This examination will inform a conservation plan, and after treatment <em>Crucifix</em> will be exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art.  </p>
          <p>The work of John Wilcox, a Texas artist active from the 1980s until his death in 2012, is precise, planned, and methodical. His working methods are rhythmic, his materials meaningful and purposeful and the final works a reflection of his complex working process.  Wilcox&#8217;s body of work on canvas and paper spans several different styles, using a broad range of materials and techniques to create abstract, subtle surfaces and color compositions. </p>

          <p><em>Crucifix </em>comprises four stretched canvases to which Wilcox applied four different materials: ash, red clay, sawdust, and cloth. This project will focus on understanding Wilcox&#8217;s working methods and materials through technical study, including surface examination and material analysis. </p>
          <p>The work sustained water damage in storage, and a treatment technique must be developed to address the tide-line staining that interferes with the intended appearance of each individual panel. Wilcox&#8217;s <em>Third Prayer</em>, in the collection of the Dallas Museum of Art, will also be examined in relation to <em>Crucifix</em>, and additional works by the artist will be available for further technical analysis if needed.  </p>
