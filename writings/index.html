          <p>In writings ranging from journals and letters to workshop manuals, autobiographies, and poems, visual artists turn to text to describe the materials and techniques of their practice. Cennino Cennini instructed young painters in grinding pigments and preparing wooden panels in a vernacular manual that is also a nascent history and theory of Renaissance art. Jacopo Pontormo logged the day’s work along with his meals and his various physical complaints, and Benvenuto Cellini dramatized the casting of his bronze <em>Perseus</em>. Michelangelo’s Sonnet 5 is a wry lament about the torments of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel&#58; &ldquo;...the brush that is always above my face, by dribbling down, makes it an ornate pavement.&rdquo; Eugène Delacroix kept dozens of journals over the course of forty years, many of them bringing together text and sketches. And in three published journals Anne Truitt wrote to understand her work as a sculptor and as a mother. </p>

          <p>This symposium brings together art historians, curators, and conservators to explore artists&#8217; writings on materials and techniques. The aim of the symposium is twofold: first, to define and explore the range of artists&#8217; texts that treat working practices, and by extension to understand the relationships between artists&#8217; textual and visual practices; and second, to ask how these writings inform our work as scholars, curators, and conservators. Convened by the Edith O’Donnell Institute of Art History, the symposium will take place over the course of two days in Fall 2016, and participants&#8217; essays will appear in an edited volume.</p>
