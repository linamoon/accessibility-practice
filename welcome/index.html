          <p>The Edith O&#8217;Donnell Institute of Art History was founded in 2014 with a $17,000,000 endowment gift from Mrs. Edith O&#8217;Donnell, an important Dallas philanthropist. Her charge was to invent a new kind of art historyâ€”what she called &quot;Art History, UT Dallas style.&quot; What she envisioned was an art history open to multidisciplinary research and at home in a university on the cutting edge of the sciences and technology. Since then, Mrs. O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s endowment has been enriched by $10,000,000 from the State of Texas and $3,000,000 from other philanthropists.</p>
          <p>Since our founding in 2014 we have built two headquarters: our main offices in the Edith O&#8217;Donnell Arts and Technology Building at UT Dallas and a research center at the Dallas Museum of Art. In the coming years, we will build a faculty, a newly formed graduate program, a research library, and a museum on the already strong foundation of our existing art history program. Our first O&#8217;Donnell Distinguished Chair is in the area of Conservation Science and represents a full partnership between the DMA, the O&#8217;Donnell Institute, and UT Dallas&#8217;s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.</p>
          <p>This website is a continuously evolving record of our growth and transformation, as well as a source of information about our scholars, students, programs, and partnerships. I welcome you to it in the name of our founder, Edith O&#8217;Donnell.</p>
          <p>&mdash; Dr. Richard R. Brettell <br />
            Founding Director, The Edith O&#8217;Donnell Institute of Art History <br />
            and the Margaret McDermott Distinguished Chair</p>
