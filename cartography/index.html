        <p><span class="paragraph-lead">In the first centuries of print</span>, cities were usually depicted as if seen from a hilltop instead of in the ichnographic (directly from above) mode of modern city maps. As surveying technologies accelerated, so too did production and accuracy of bird&#8217;s-eye views. </p>
        <p>Yet despite the explosion of treatises instructing how to measure land, little guidance was given in such texts about how to convert survey data into convincing and pleasing pictures. </p>
        <p>Even the most luxuriously illustrated technical treatises of the era emphasized the tools and fieldwork of the surveyor, not the ultimate product—the view—that would be seen and appreciated by the public. </p>
        <p>The views themselves often minimized or obscured the true methods of their production, even at times falsely insisting  upon them being &#8220;viewed&#8221; (rather than measured) by an observer figure from a hilltop, as if the view were simply drawn directly from life. </p>
